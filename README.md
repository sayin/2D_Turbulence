# 2D_Turbulence
This repository contains code for data-driven (ANN/CNN) LES of two-dimensional turbulence. Now working towards implementing E/SRGAN architecture for upscaling coarser simulation data to DNS field without solving NS equations numerically. 

Work still under Progress. Estimated time to complete -April 2020
